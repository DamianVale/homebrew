For example, at 10th level, you could swap a Maneuvers  for a Maneuvers  of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new Maneuvers .\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Maneuvers s Readied\nYou must ready Maneuvers s before you can use them by praying for 5 minutes. They stay readied until you pray again and change them. When you initiate a Maneuvers , you expend it for the current encounter, so each one can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). \n___\nYou do not control access to your readied Maneuvers s. Before you take your first turn in an encounter, two of your readied Maneuvers s are granted to you at random. The rest of your readied Maneuvers s are withheld. At the end of each turn, a random previously withheld Maneuvers  is granted to you. You can freely choose to initiate any granted Maneuvers , but you cannot initiate a withheld Maneuvers . \n___\nIf you cannot be granted a Maneuvers  because you have no withheld Maneuvers  remaining, instead you recover all expended Maneuvers s, a new set of readied Maneuvers s (as many as you started the combat with) is granted to you at random and the whole process begins again. You begin an encounter with an additional granted Maneuvers  at 10th level and again at 20th level.\n\n#### Initiating a Maneuvers \nBecause you do not have spell slots, you do not expend spell slots when initiating a Maneuvers . Instead, it is simply expended and must be recovered as above. When determining the effect of a Maneuvers , you treat the Maneuvers  as having been used from a slot of level equal to your highest known Maneuvers  level (except that cantrips work as normal).\n\n#### Initiating Ability\nThe initiating ability you use depends on which discipline you're using. Each one has two listed, and you use the higher one - the ones a crusader can access are Devoted Spirit (Con Cha), Stone Dragon (Str Con), and White Raven (Wis Cha).\n___\nYou use your initiating ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your initiating ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Maneuvers  you initiate or when making an attack roll with one.\n___\n**Maneuvers  Save DC** ": null, " mark the delayed damage separately.

That discipline gives additional class features at 3rd, 13th and 17th levels.\n\n### Ability Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\n### Extra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\n### Smite\nFrom 6th level, once per turn, when you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can expend a Maneuvers  to deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage, times your highest Maneuvers  level, to the target rather than using the Maneuvers  normally.\n\n### Zealous Surge\nFrom 9th level, you can re-roll a saving throw. This ability does not require an action. You simply decide to use it after seeing the result of your saving throw roll but before the DM tells you if it fails or succeeds. Once you use this ability, you must complete a long rest to use it again.\n\n### Die Hard\nFrom 10th level, when you fall unconscious, you automatically become stable and don't need to take death saves - though attacking you while unconscious or abilities which kill you outright can still kill you.\n\n### Mettle\nFrom 14th level, whenever you take a constitution or wisdom save for half damage, instead you take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful save.\n\n### Double Strike\nAt 20th level, when you initiate a Maneuvers  which affects your next attack, it affects both of the attacks in your next attack action. When you initiate a Maneuvers  which has you make a weapon attack as part of the effect, you attack twice and the effects apply to both attacks.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Swordsage\n\nA master of martial Maneuvers s, the sword sage is a physical adept \u2014 a blade wizard whose knowledge of the Sublime Way lets them unlock potent abilities, many of which are overtly supernatural or magical in nature.

From 16th level, you are immune to fire while in this stance.\n\n#### Cloak of Calamity (5*)\nYou channel your inner disrespect for the victims of fires before yours and wear it as armour against those who would oppose you. Whenever an adjacent opponent hits you with a melee attack, they take 5 points of fire damage.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Why did you rename...\n___\n**A:** Let me stop you right there. Yes, I know technically the word literally means any total burning of something, but it usually refers to a historical event which...\n___\n**Q:** You mean a historical event like the Crusades?\n___\n**A:** Ignoring the difference between living memory and medi\u00e6val history, crusade is probably more commonly used to mean any militaristic action of perceived righteousness (\"Will you join in our crusade, will you take your place with me? Beyond the barricade is there a place you long to see?\") than the actual Crusades. Oh, and if I renamed the crusader, it would throw everyone off - everyone remembers that the initiators are swordsage, warblade and crusader, not zealot.\n___\n**Q:** So what was wrong with \"Wyrm's Breath\" then?\n___\n**A:** It was boring and we have upcasting now. You'll notice it also does a totally different thing. That's why a lot of the \"Such and such only better\" Maneuvers s are gone or do different things from they used to.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Rising Phoenix (15***)\nA column of superheated air lifts you up as though you had been reborn from your own ashes. While you are in this stance, you can fly as fast as you can walk, and can hover, but you can only actually float 10 feet in the air above a solid or liquid surface (though that's not to say that the surface has to be able to support your weight). If you ever aren't within 10 feet of such a surface, the stance ends, which will usually drop you down to the ground below (though if on any of your turns you are up to 10 feet above the ground, you can enter the stance again to save yourself and are very lucky).\n\nWhenever you take the attack action, the column bursts into flame, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to any creature within 5 feet of the column of air except for you (the column occupies your space, and each of the spaces directly between you and the surface below).\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Devoted Spirit\n___\n*\"Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light\"*\n\n*\u2014 Helen Keller*\n#\nF - Faith, piety, and purity of body and mind are the wellsprings of a warrior\u2019s true power. Devoted Spirit Maneuvers s harness a practitioner\u2019s spiritual strength and her zealous devotion to a cause. This discipline includes energies baneful to a creature opposed to the Devoted Spirit student\u2019s cause, abilities that can keep an adept fighting long after a more mundane warrior would fall to his enemies, and strikes infused with vengeful, fanatical power.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Intimidation\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Constitution, Charisma\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Opportune Moment\nWhen you take this favoured discipline at 3rd level, you gain the ability to take a opportunty attack once per round without using your reaction to do so.\n\n### Aura of Thorns\nStarting from 13th level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal half as much damage back to the attacker. Apply your resistance or vulnerability to the damage, not theirs (suppose a creature who is resistant to slashing rolls 10 slashing damage against you while you're vulnerable to slashing. You take 20 damage, so the creature takes 10).\n\n### Zeal and Fury\nFrom 17th level, you put your weight into your attacks while using your force of personality to guide your weapon. The first time you hit an enemy with a melee weapon attack in a round, the attack deals extra damage equal to your constitution modifier **times** your charisma modifier. Use the absolute value of each, to a minimum of 1 - if one of these ability scores slips below 8, this means that you actually start landing stronger and stronger blows in your desperation!\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** What does \"Absolute value\" mean?\n___\n**A:** The absolute value of a positive number equals that number. The absolute value of a negative number equals that number, times -1 -  the absolute values of 2 and -2 are both 2.\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Devoted Spirit discipline.

Further, damage the attack deals is true damage instead of damage of its original type - true damage cannot be prevented, mitigated or resisted by any means whatsoever.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Shield Block\n**2nd-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** 5 feet\n\n**Components:** S, M (A statuette of a shield)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen an enemy attacks an adjacent ally while you wield a shield, you can initiate this Maneuvers  to reduce the attack roll by 4, plus your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Defensive Rebuke\n**3rd-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** S, M (a thorn)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nFor 1 round, you gain the ability to draw the aggression of your enemies. Each enemy you hit while this Maneuvers  is active provokes an opportunity attack from you for every single attack they make which targets one of your allies (other than you), and these extra opportunity attacks do not use up your reaction. These enemies are aware of the consequences of attacking your allies due to this ability.\n\n#### Divine Surge\n**4th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack which deals additional damage equal to 2d8, plus 1d8 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Daunting Strike\n**5th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a snarling face carved in wood)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou make a melee attack as part of this Maneuvers . If you hit, the enemy must take a wisdom save or be frightened of you for one round.\n\n#### Zealous Charge\n**5th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A page from a holy text)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou dash as part of this Maneuvers . Your next melee attack channels divine fury. If you are good and the target is evil or vice versa, or lawful neutral and the target is chaotic, or chaotic neutral and the target is lawful, or true neutral and the target is neutral on neither axis, the attack deals extra damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level and you get resistance to damage for 1 round.\n\n#### Rallying Strike\n**6th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self/30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, M (A piece of a flag)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment which is not exactly identical to yours and who poses a threat to you or your allies in a direct, immediate way, you and all allies within 30 feet are healed for 1d6 times (your highest Maneuvers  level, minus 3) - initially 3d6 - plus your initiating ability modifier.\n\n#### Castigating Strike\n**7th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** See text\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment that is not exactly identical to yours, the target takes radiant damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. Each other enemy within 30 feet takes 3d6 less damage and takes a constitution save for half damage. The initial target also takes a constitution save. Each creature who fails has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** Do unaligned creatures have an alignment which is not exactly identical to mine?\n___\n**A:** No. They do not have an alignment at all.\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Shield Counter\n**7th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Your reach\n\n**Components:** V, M (A statuette of a knight with a shield)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen an enemy within reach attacks an ally, but before they roll to hit, you can use this Maneuvers  to whack them with your shield (if you're wielding one). Treat the shield as a mace. If you hit the enemy, their attack automatically misses.\n\n#### Sacrificial Divine Surge\n**8th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou lose a positive whole number of points of constitution of your choice, then make a melee attack which deals an extra 8d6 points of damage, or 10d6 if your highest Maneuvers  level is 9th. For each point of constitution you lose, you get a +1 bonus to the attack roll and deal another 2d6 points of damage.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\nLost points of constitution that you accept in this way are automatically restored at a rate of one per hour.\n\n#### Strike of Righteous Vitality\n**9th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** See text\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment which is not exactly identical to yours and who poses a threat to you or your allies in a direct, immediate way, you or an ally within 10 feet is healed for 100 hit points, and any disease affecting them is cured, along with the blinded and deafened conditions.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Devoted Spirit discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of devoted spirit Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of devoted spirit Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 11** means you must know two devoted spirit Maneuvers s and have reached 11th level.\n\n#### Iron Guard's Glare (1)\nYour steely gaze causes even the most resolute of foes to have trouble looking away to attack your allies.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, enemies within your reach have disadvantage on attack rolls against your allies (other than you), though they are aware of this.\n\n#### Martial Spirit (1)\nYour lust for battle is infectious, inspiring your allies to keep fighting despite - or perhaps even because of - their wounds.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, whenever you hit an enemy who poses a genuine threat to you with a melee attack, you or an ally within 30 feet is healed for 2 points of damage.\n\n#### Thicket of Blades (5*)\nYour weapon is held ready to strike any creature who makes even the slightest movement.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, your enemies can't avoid provoking opportunity attacks from you by taking the disengage action. Further, an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you when they move out of any square you can reach, not just out of your reach entirely.\n\n#### Aura of Zeal (11**)\nYou fill yourself with righteous indignation or vile pride, empowering yourself to become the embodiment of the alignment you stand for. \n___\nWhile you are in this stance, you gain two of the following benefits based on your alignment:\n\n- **Chaotic:** Whenever you roll the maximum result on a damage die, treat it as double its actual result (so when you wield a greatsword, each d6 can roll 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 12).\n- **Lawful:** When you make any roll, you can choose to use your passive result plus 1.\n- **Neither:** Once per round, instead of rolling a d20 roll, you can roll 2+((1d2-1)*17) instead (that is, flip a coin: heads is 19, tails is 2).\n- **Good:** Whenever you or an ally within 10 feet hits an evil creature with a melee weapon attack, the attacker heals 2d6 hit points.\n\n- **Evil:** Whenever a good creature hits you or an ally within 10 feet with a melee weapon attack, the attacker takes 2d6 points of necrotic damage.\n- **Neither:** You get both of the above benefits, but the damage or healing is only 1d6 points.\n\n#### Immortal Fortitude (15***)\nDespite the horrific wounds you suffer, the flash of searing spells, and the crash of a foe's mighty attacks, you stand resolute on the field. So long as the potential for victory exists, you fight on.\n___\nWhile in this stance, if you take enough damage to reduce you to 0 hit points, calculate the damage you have taken beyond enough to reduce you to 0 (essentially, the number of hit points below 0 the damage would reduce you to if that were possible). Take a constitution save with a DC equal to half of that value. If you pass, you do not fall unconscious, and instead, you are reduced to 1 hit point, instead of 0.\n___\nRelying on this power is dangerous, however. Each time you successfully save yourself from unconsciousness with this stance, mark a single failed death save on yourself even though you are still conscious. This failed death save lasts until you leave this stance. If you really are knocked unconscious, you start rolling for further death saves as normal.\n___\nIf you pass a third constitution save, you don't die instantly despite having three failed death saves marked on you, but you can't attempt to save yourself from unconsciousness while you have three failed death saves on you, so you will need to leave the stance and enter it again. If you are reduced to 0 hit points a fourth time, you will die outright because you have three failed death saves.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Does Thicket of Blades allow me to make more than one opportunity attack in a round? What if I also use Defensive Rebuke?\n___\n**A:** No. Defensive Rebuke only allows you to make its own opportunity attacks for free, not opportunity attacks in general or the ones that Thicket of Blades provides you. If you use both, you can take one attack for each time an enemy attacks an ally, plus one more total for either thicket of blades' effect or a standard opportunity attack\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Diamond Mind\n___\n*\"An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded.\"*\n\n*\u2014 Isador Akios*, Dawn of War\n#\nTrue quickness lies in the mind, not the body. A student of the Diamond Mind discipline seeks to hone his perceptions and discipline his thoughts so that he can act in slivers of time so narrow that others cannot even perceive them. A corollary of this speed of thought and action is the concept of the mind as the battleground. An enemy defeated in his mind must inevitably be defeated in the realm of the physical as well.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Investigation\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Strength, Intelligence\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Clock of Perfect Quartz\nWhen you take this favoured discipline at 3rd level, you can take an investigation check instead of a constitution save to maintain concentration on a Maneuvers .\n\n### Malachite Ph\u0153nix Shield\nFrom 13th level, your physical strength and mental resolve allow you to tap into the powers of life and rebirth. Any damage you would take is reduced by your strength modifier + your intelligence modifier.\n\n### Strike of Obsidian Shards\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to perform a special attack called a strike of obsidian shards, by slamming your weapon so hard into the ground that it shatters into pieces, striking every opponent within your choice of a 60 foot line, a 30 foot cone, or a 10 foot radius burst centered on you. Your sheer force of will guides the shards unerringly into your foes, with no chance for them to avoid the attack, and around your allies, automatically missing them, and once the strike of obsidian shards is completed, your weapon reforms in your hand, undamaged by the attack.\n___\nHowever, the true power of the strike of obsidian shards is that it can replace any melee attack, applying any bonus effect to every single hit you land with the attack as well as doing normal weapon damage. This includes the melee attack made as part of a Maneuvers .\n___\nOnce you have used the strike of obsidian shards, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.\n\n___\n___\n___\n___\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Diamond Mind discipline. To learn one, you must know at least one other diamond mind Maneuvers  per asterisk (*) after the level.\n\n##### 1st Level\nNightmare Blade, Onyx Mind\n##### 2nd Level\nAquamarine Flow, Emerald Razor\n##### 3rd Level*\nGarnet Strike, Opal Armour\n##### 4th Level**\nBounding Assault, Disrupting Blow (Staggering Smite), Mind Strike\n##### 5th Level**\nRapid Counter\n##### 6th Level**\nMoment of Alacrity, Moonstone Strike\n##### 7th Level***\nAvalanche of Blades, Aquamarine Motion\n##### 8th Level\nDiamond Defence\n##### 9th Level\nTime Stands Still\n\n#### Nightmare Blade\n**1st-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A small glass bead that imitates the relevant gem - see below)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour blade becomes the stuff of nightmares, even it takes on the lustrous hue of a gemstone. Before you attack, the creature you attempt to attack must take a wisdom save. If they fail, you get advantage on the attack roll. The attack also deals extra damage, though it only does half as much if the save is passed - as your highest Maneuvers  level increases, the nightmare blade changes in power and appearance:\n\n- **1st: Sapphire:** 1d6 points of cold damage.\n- **2nd: Peridot:** 1d8 points of acid damage.\n- **3rd: Amber:** 1d10 points of lightning damage.\n- **4th: Ruby:** 2d6 points of fire damage.\n- **5th: Topaz:** 2d8 points of thunder damage\n- **6th: Malachite:** 2d10 points of poison damage.\n- **7th: Amethyst:** 4d6 points of psychic damage\n- **8th: Diamond:** 4d8 points of force damage.\n- **9th: Obsidian** 4d10 points of necrotic damage\n___\nThese effects are cumulative, so an obsidian nightmare blade deals a total of 7d10+7d8+7d6 extra damage.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Onyx Mind\n**1st-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a black glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou focus your mind to gain advantage on a wisdom or charisma save and you are always considered proficient.\n\n#### Aquamarine Flow\n**2nd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a blue glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour mind and body alike flow faster. You gain advantage on an intelligence or dexterity save and are treated as proficient.\n\n#### Emerald Razor\n**2nd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a green glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour blade glows green like an emerald, and carves straight through armour. You make a single attack against an enemy, replacing the static part of your opponent's listed AC with 10 and ignoring any shield they're wielding. For example, normally, a creature with studded leather armour would have an AC of 12 + their dexterity modifier. You treat it as 10 + their dexterity modifier. A creature with plate armour and a shield would normally have an AC of 20, but you treat it as 10. You also ignore any effect which sets someone's AC to a certain value or minimum (like mage armour or barkskin) or gives a static bonus to it (like shield).\n\n#### Opal Armour\n**3rd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a multi coloured glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour body and mind harden. You gain advantage on a strength or constitution save and are considered proficient.\n\n#### Garnet Strike\n**3rd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (A purple glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n___\nFor the duration, when you hit with a melee attack, you can roll an investigation check and use that instead of the normal damage roll. In this case, you don't add your strength modifier to the damage. You usually do damage equal to 1d20 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier.\n\n#### Bounding Assault\n\n**4th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round.\n___\nYou dash as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . You get advantage on melee attack rolls this turn.\n\n#### Mind Strike\n\n**4th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou attempt to bring your weapon down on an enemy's head. You make an attack, and if it hits, the target loses 1d4 points of wisdom. A successful wisdom save halves the reduction. Lost wisdom points are restored at a rate of 1 per hour.\n\n#### Rapid Counter\n\n**5th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** None!\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou immediately take an opportunity attack against a creature who has just provoked one. You can then use your reaction to make an actual opportunity attack as well, if you still have your reaction, or you can save it for something else.\n\n#### Moment of Alacrity\n\n**6th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nThis Maneuvers  initially does nothing, but at the start of the next round, your initiative count increases by 20 for the rest of the encounter, usually meaning that you'll go first.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** What does Moment of Alacrity do if I houserule that we roll initiative each round?\n___\n**A:** Change the text of Moment of Alacrity to read \"This Maneuvers  gives a +20 bonus to the initiative rolls for the rest of the combat.\" However, its duration is still instantaneous, so it can't be dispelled to remove the +20.\n___\n**Q:** Does Moment of Alacrity stack with itself?\n___\n**A:** Technically no, functionally yes. It's a bit like asking if two fireballs stack. Your initiative will increase by 20, and then by 20 again, so the answer to the question you're really asking is \"yes\". The altered version to handle people's house rules doesn't, as written, stack with itself, but any DM who writes house rules has their own opinion of whether or not it should.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** Moving on, what happens if I use an ability like nightmare blade while using Garnet or Moonstone Strike?\n___\n**A:** Garnet and Moonstone Strike only replace the weapon damage and your strength modifier. So Garnet Strike + Amber Nightmare Blade ": "1d20 + 1d10 + 1d8 + 1d6 + proficiency + intelligence.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Moonstone Strike\n**6th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (A white glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n___\nFor the duration, whenever you hit with a melee attack, you can roll two investigation checks and add them together instead of the weapon's normal damage roll and use that instead. In this case, you don't add your strength modifier to the damage. Essentially, you usually do damage equal to 2d20 + twice your proficiency bonus + twice your intelligence modifier.\n\n#### Avalanche of Blades\n\n**7th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make an attack action as part of initiating this Maneuvers . You get advantage on each attack, and if the attack hits, you can make another attack without advantage, and if that attack also hits, you can make yet another attack, this one with disadvantage. If you make an attack with an offhand weapon this turn, you can do the same with that weapon as well.\n\n#### Aquamarine Motion\n\n**7th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou channel a watery flow through your mind, allowing you to move instantly as though it were your turn.\n\n#### Diamond Defence\n\n**8th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a colorless glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nWhen you would make a saving throw, you can use this Maneuvers  before making the roll. You automatically pass the saving throw instead of rolling it.\n\n___\n\nAlternatively, when you fail a saving throw, you can use this Maneuvers  to re-roll it, and you get advantage on the re-roll. In this case, you use it after the DM reveals whether the roll is passed or failed.\n\n#### Time Stands Still\n\n**9th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nTake an extra turn after this one. During the extra turn, you can't use this Maneuvers  again.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Can I take a reaction between my turns? Do I get an extra reaction per round when I get an extra turn?\n___\n**A:** Yes to both questions, though you don't usually have much opportunity to use the reaction.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Diamond Mind discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of diamond mind Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of diamond mind Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two diamond mind Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n\n#### Tiger's Eye Clarity (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, you focus on defending yourself against one particular enemy to the exclusion of all others. That enemy has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, but other enemies have advantage on attack rolls against you. You choose an enemy to defend yourself against when you enter the stance in combat, whenever you enter combat, and at the start of each of your turns in combat.\n\n#### Pearl of Black Doubt (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, your dodges crush the spirit of enemies with every miss. You get a bonus to AC equal to the number of attacks that have missed you since your last turn.\n\n#### Prismatic Wind (9**)\nYour perception becomes so fine-tuned that you can hear your foes' slightest movements on the wind, allowing you to locate invisible enemies with pinpoint accuracy. While you are in this stance, you have blindsight out to 30 feet, and advantage on perception checks to hear creatures.\n\n#### Declaration in Jade (15***)\nYour hand glows a bright green colour, and seems to move almost of its own accord. While you are in this stance, you can initiate one Maneuvers  that would normally use your reaction without actually using your reaction - essentially, you get an extra reaction each round that can only be used to initiate Maneuvers s.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Iron Heart\n___\n*\"The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions but by iron and blood.\"*\n\n*\u2014 Otto von Bismarck*\n#\nAbsolute mastery of the sword is the goal of the Iron Heart discipline.

If your modified attack roll is higher than the attack roll that just hit you, the attack misses instead. The exception is that if the original attack roll was a critical hit, you must also score a critical hit to deflect the attack, but if you score a critical hit, the attack is deflected no matter how high it is.\n\n- Critical attack only: Never deflects\n- Critical reaction only: Always deflects\n- Critical attack and reaction: Always deflects.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** [Literally any question involving Iron Heart Surge.]\n___\n**A:** For the uninitiated, Iron Heart Surge used to be a Maneuvers  that was clearly meant to allow you to resist abilities, but ended up letting you dispel them instead. It's not clear exactly what it was meant to allow you to resist - try working out what \"spell, effect, or other condition currently affecting you\" means. Particularly liberal interpretations might have let you shrug off the sun. Rather than work out what the hell it's meant to do, it's now dispel magic.

You get a +2 bonus on each of the attack rolls.\n\n#### Dazing Strike\n**5th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou bring your weapon down hard, potentially dazing your opponent. Your attack deals normal damage if it hits, and if it does, your target must take a constitution save. If they fail the save, they can't take any actions or reactions for one round, and if they've taken their reaction this round, they don't recover it on their next turn.\n\n#### Iron Heart Focus\n**5th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a pinch of iron filings)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou can use this Maneuvers  when you fail a saving throw to re-roll the saving throw. You still have any bonuses, penalties, advantage or disadvantage that you had on the initial roll.\n\n#### Iron Heart Endurance\n**6th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a drop of your own blood)\n\n**Duration:** 1 minute\n___\nYou gain temporary hit points equal to four times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Manticore Parry\n**6th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a fragment of manticore spine)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nManticore Parry works like Wall of Blades (see previous page) except that if you deflect a melee attack, you can redirect the attack into another creature adjacent to you (ignoring whether or not the attacker could normally hit that creature from where they're standing). Use the attacker's initial attack roll to determine whether the attack hits or misses its new target (if the attack roll was initially 20, it will critically hit the new target).\n\n#### Shatter the Rust\n**7th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a few flakes of rust)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack against a creature, which does additional damage equal to the difference between that creature's maximum and current hit points, or half as much on a successful constitution save.\n\n#### Wolfram Scything Blade\n**7th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n___\nYour blade moves with unparallelled speed. Whenever you hit for the first time in your turn with a melee weapon attack, you can make one more melee attack, but only against a different target.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** How does Wolfram Scything Blade work with other Maneuvers s?\n___\n**A:** You can both make a scything attack and a disarming attack if you have WSB active when you use disarming strike, and the scything attack gives you another disarming attack. You can re-roll the WSB attack with lighting recovery or use lightning recovery to make an attack hit so you can claim the WSB attack. You can choose what order you attack enemies with for mithral tornado, and when the first of those attacks hit, hit another using WSB. You get a normal extra attack with dazing strike and shatter the rust, not one with a bonus effect. You don't get any benefit with wall of blades or exorcism of steel at all.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Adamantine Hurricane\n**8th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a butterfly wing)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou spin around with your blade, striking multiple foes. Make two melee attacks against each enemy within your reach. You get a +4 bonus on each of the attack rolls.\n\n#### Titanium Throw\n**8th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 30 foot line\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou throw your weapon, and it bursts straight through every single creature in its path, before levitating ominously back to your hand. Each creature on a 30 foot line takes 15d6 points of damage. A successful dexterity save halves the damage.\n\n#### Strike of Orichalcum Clarity\n**9th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a single melee attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 100 points of damage to the target. If the attack is a critical hit, it deals an extra 200 points of damage to the target instead.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Iron Heart discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of iron heart Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of iron heart Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two iron heart Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n___\n\n#### Punishing Stance (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, you deal 1d6 extra points of damage with each attack, but take a -2 penalty to your AC.\n\n#### Absolute Steel (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, your speed increases by 10 feet. If you move at least 10 feet away from your initial position in a round, you get a +1 bonus to AC during that round.\n\n#### Dancing Blade Form (9**)\nWhile you are in this stance, your reach increases by 5 feet during your turn only. Outside of your turn, you use your ordinary reach for determining whether or not enemies provoke opportunity attacks from you and the reach of any attacks you can make as a reaction.\n\n#### Supreme Blade Parry (15***)\nWhile you are in this stance, so long as you are proficient with a melee weapon you are wielding (not just your unarmed strike) you reduce any damage you take by your proficiency bonus, after applying any damage resistance or vulnerability, to a minimum of 0.\n\n# The Jade Ph\u0153nix\n___\n*\"\"The ph\u0153nix must burn to emerge.\"*\n\n*\u2015 Janet Fitch,* White Oleander\n\n#\nManeuvers s and magic cannot stand apart for long.

Double the short and long range of any weapon you wield.\n\n### Dark Sun Master\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to fire a storm of arrows instead of one of your attacks.

Martin,* A Storm of Swords\n#\nStrength is an illusion. Adherents of the Setting Sun philosophy understand that no warrior can hope to be stronger, quicker, and more skillful than every one of their enemies. Therefore, this discipline includes Maneuvers s that use an adversary\u2019s power and speed against them. Setting Sun Maneuvers  include throws and imitative strikes. The highest forms of the Setting Sun require an adept to empty themself of preconception and impulse to become a hollow vessel unhindered by want.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Insight\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Intelligence, Wisdom\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Falling Star Strike\nWhen you choose this discipline at 3rd level, your unarmed strike damage increases to 1d4. This increases again to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level. You can use your dexterity instead of your strength to determine your bonus to attack and damage rolls with an unarmed strike. Also, while you are unarmed, you can treat your unarmed strike as a melee weapon you are holding whenever a Maneuvers  or stance specifies that it requires you to have a weapon.\n\n### Waning Moon Sight\nAt 13th level, you learn to perceive enemies you can't see. You get blindsight out to 10 feet.\n\n### Dying World Ultimatum\nFrom 17th level, when a creature misses you with a melee attack while you are unarmed, you can immediately make an unarmed strike against them if you are in range to do so.

If they fail, you swap positions with them (whichever of you is larger chooses where they end up, but must occupy the other's entire previous space). If there is no way that you can both be positioned, you don't move.\n\n#### Feigned Opening\n**3rd-level Setting Sun**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou can initiate this Maneuvers  when an enemy makes an opportunity attack against you, just before they roll the attack roll.

If the insight check result is greater than the attack roll, change the target of the attack to any creature adjacent to you other than the attacker (even if they're not in the attacker's reach).

If the attack hits, the target cannot make more than one attack in a single action, bonus action or reaction for 1 minute, or 1 round if they make a successful constitution save. This usually prevents the extra attack, multiattack and flurry of blows abilities from working properly, but not two-weapon fighting or the monk's single extra martial arts attack.\n\n#### Fool's Strike\n**8th-level Setting Sun**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen an enemy hits or misses you with an attack, you can initiate this Maneuvers  and make an insight check.

Whenever you move at least 10 feet, you can throw an enemy without taking an action to do so. The creature you are trying to throw makes a dexterity save, but for this save, the DC is (8 + your proficiency bonus + your initiating ability modifier + 2 for every 5 feet you have moved so far this turn).\n___\nIf the save is failed, you can throw the target up to 10 feet, plus a number of feet equal to the number by which the target failed the save, and they take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage, plus bludgeoning damage equal to the number by which they failed the save, and fall prone.\n___\nEach time you move at least 10 feet, you can throw the same or a different creature.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Setting Sun discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of setting sun Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of setting sun Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two setting sun Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n\n#### Step of the Wind (1)\nWhile in this stance, you take no penalty for moving through difficult terrain and enemies who are in difficult terrain have disadvantage on saving throws against setting sun Maneuvers s, as well as on opposed checks to avoid a grapple or trip attack you make.\n\n#### Giant-Killing Style (5*)\nWhile in this stance, you have advantage on attack and damage rolls against creatures of a larger size category than yours.\n\n#### Shifting Defence (9**)\nWhile you are in this stance, you can move 5 feet as a reaction when a creature makes a melee attack against you, and this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. If you are no longer within that creature's melee attack range, that attack will miss automatically.\n\n#### Ghostly Defence (15***)\nWhile you are in this stance, if a creature who has disadvantage attacks you and misses, you can redirect their attack to another creature adjacent to you (not the attacker), using their higher attack roll as the new attack roll. \n___\nUnlike many other attack redirection abilities, this works on ranged attacks but the target must be one the attacker could target normally.\n\n# The Shadow Hand\n___\n*\"Everything that we see is a shadow cast by that which we do not see.\"*\n\n*\u2015 Martin Luther King Junior.*\n\n#\nNever show an adversary what they expect to see. The Shadow Hand discipline emphasizes deception, misdirection, and surprise. The most effective blow is one struck against an enemy who does not even know they are in danger.

If you do so, make a single melee attack as an action. If the attack hits, the target must take a constitution saving throw.\n___\nIf the saving throw is failed, they die outright. If the attack succeeds, they take true damage equal to half their current hit points - true damage cannot be prevented, resisted or mitigated by any means.\n___\nIf the attack hits, you cannot attempt another such attack until you complete a long rest (irrespective of whether the save is passed or failed). If it misses, you can attempt it again as soon as you have an action available to do so.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Shadow Hand discipline. To learn one, you must know at least one other shadow hand Maneuvers  per asterisk (*) after the level.\n\n##### 1st Level\nClinging Shadow Strike, Shadow Blade Technique\n\n##### 2nd Level\nCloak of Deception (Invisibility), Draining Strike, Shadow Jaunt (Misty Step)\n\n##### 3rd Level*\nShadow Garrotte\n\n##### 4th Level**\nDim Mak, Obscuring Shadow Veil\n\n##### 5th Level**\nBloodletting Strike, Shadow Stride (Far Step<SUP>XGtE</SUP>)\n\n##### 6th Level***\nShadow Noose, Stalker in the Night\n\n##### 7th Level***\nDeath in the Dark, One with Shadow (Etherealness) Shadow Blink (Teleportation)\n\n##### 8th Level***\nEnervating Shadow Strike\n\n##### 9th Level*****\nFive-Shadow Creeping-Ice Enervation Strike\n\n##### \"Flat-Footed\"\nThe following Maneuvers s and stances occasionally refer to an enemy being flat-footed. This doesn't refer to their actual feet (although the term originates from the idea that an enemy hasn't had time to get up on the balls of their feet yet).\n___\nInstead, you catch an opponent flat-footed with an attack whenever you have advantage on the attack roll against them, or another of that creature's enemies is within 5 feet of them and you don't have disadvantage on the attack. This is similar to the criteria for the rogue's sneak attack.\n\n#### Clinging Shadow Strike\n**1st-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou make a melee attack which does 1d6 extra points of damage if it hits, plus 1d6 per 2 highest Maneuvers  levels after 1st.\n___\nFurther, the target must take a constitution save or have disadvantage on all attack rolls for one round.\n\n#### Shadow Blade Technique\n**1st-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack with advantage. If both die rolls are high enough to hit, the attack does additional cold damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Draining Strike\n**2nd-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack. If it hits, choose an ability score. The target must take a saving throw on that ability score or lose a number of points of that score equal to your highest Maneuvers  level. For example, as a level 7 swordsage, if you choose constitution, the target must take a constitution save or lose 4 points of constitution. Lost ability score points return at a rate of 1 per hour from each ability score.\n\n#### Shadow Garrotte\n**3rd-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 60 ft\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (A strip of cloth)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous/1 round\n___\nChoose a target in range. A shadowy garrotte strangles that creature, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage plus necrotic damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. The target must take a constitution save. If it fails, attacks against it have advantage for one round.\n\n#### Dim Mak\n**4th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Touch\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 3 rounds/1 round\n___\nYou touch a flat-footed creature. That creature is paralysed for 3 rounds, but a successful constitution save reduces this to just 1 round.\n\n#### Obscuring Shadow Veil\n**4th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou make a melee attack which does 1d6 extra points of damage if it hits, plus 1d6 per 2 highest Maneuvers  levels after 4th. Further, the target must take a constitution save or be blinded for one round.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Bloodletting Strike\n**5th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (A drop of blood)\n\n**Duration:** Permanent/See text\n___\nYou make a single melee attack. The target loses a number of hit points equal to your highest Maneuvers  level at the start of each of its turns. When it does, it can take a constitution save to end the effect. Another creature's medicine check at your save DC made as an action can stop the bleeding.\n\n#### Shadow Noose\n**6th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 60 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nChoose a target in range. A shadowy noose strangles that creature, dealing necrotic damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. The target must take a constitution save. If it fails, it is paralysed for one round.\n\n#### Stalker in the Night\n**6th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** M (a black piece of cloth)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou can use this Maneuvers  only while you are hidden. Whatever actions you perform during your turn, you don't reveal yourself unless you are still exposed at the end of the round.\n___\nFor example, you could dart forwards 10 feet, attack a creature, and dart away 20 feet into hiding. The creature you attacked would know that it had taken damage, as though stabbed by an invisible blade, but not where the attack had come from.\n___\nBecause enemies are unable to locate you, you  don't provoke opportunity attacks for anything you do this turn.\n\n#### Death in the Dark\n**7th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a single melee attack against a flat-footed opponent. If the attack hits, the target must take a strength save, a dexterity save and a constitution save.\n___\nFor each failed save, the target takes additional damage equal to 3d6 plus twice your highest Maneuvers  level. For example, if you know an 8th-level Maneuvers , a target who fails 2 saves and passes 1 would take 6d6+32 points of damage.\n\n#### Enervating Shadow Strike\n**8th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** See text\n___\n\nYou wreathe your blade in necromantic energy and strike an enemy with a single melee attack as part of initiating this Maneuvers . If the attack hits, the target loses 1d4 levels!\n___\nThis works as follows: for a start, if the level loss is greater than either the target's challenge rating (if it has one) or its hit dice, it just dies. Else, for each level lost, that creature loses hit points equal to a roll of their hit die at that level, plus their constitution modifier, so a wizard 15/barbarian 2 with 16 constitution would lose 2d12+1d6+9 hit points if they lost 3 levels. This decreases their maximum and current total.\n___\nNext, the creature's proficiency bonus is recalculated as though it had fewer levels or points of challenge rating. For example, the 17th-level character's proficiency bonus is +6, but it's reduced to +5 by this effect.\n___\nFinally, the creature loses any abilities or improvement to abilities which isn't available at the new level. A 17th-level rogue who loses 3 levels only has 7d6 sneak attack after the reduction, for example. In the case of spellcasting, for simplicity's sake, the creature loses access to its highest-level spells if brought below the level they earn them, but doesn't otherwise lose spells or spell slots. For example, a 17th-level wizard who loses 3 levels loses access to 8th- and 9th-level spell slots but suffers no other loss of spellcasting.\n___\nLost levels are restored at a rate of one per 6 hours.\n___\n#### Five-Shadow Creeping-Ice Enervation Strike\n\n**9th-level Shadow Hand**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** See text\n___\n\nOur market research shows that players like abilities with really long names, so we made a Maneuvers  with the longest ability name ever!\n___\nYou make an attack with a melee weapon. If the attack hits, the target takes an additional 15d6 points of damage and loses 2d6 points from each of strength, dexerity and constitution. The target can take a save on each of these three scores to prevent losing points from it.\n___\nThe target must then take an intelligence save, failing which they have disadvantage on attack rolls for 1d6 rounds, and a wisdom save, failing which their speed is reduced to 0 feet for 1d6 rounds.\n___\nEach of the three reduced ability scores recovers at a rate of one point per hour.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Shadow Hand discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of shadow hand Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of shadow hand Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two shadow hand Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n\n### Child of Shadow (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, your enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against you if you have moved at least 15 feet away from your initial location on your previous turn - that is, you must be at least 15 feet from where you started, not just have moved 15 feet total (so you can't move around in a circle to get the benefit!).\n\n### Assassin's Stance (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, you can make one attack you make per turn which catches an enemy flat-footed with a finesse or ranged weapon deal an extra 2d6 points of damage, just like a 3rd-level rogue can using their sneak attack ability - the two stack.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** I'm a fifth-level swordsage, fifth-level rogue. Can I use my assassin's stance to deal 2d6 extra damage to one creature, and my sneak attack to deal 3d6 extra damage to another, using two separate attacks?\n___\n**A:** Yes, you can apply each to a separate attack.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n### Dance of the Spider (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, you can traverse walls and water as easily as the floor. You'll fall as normal at the end of your turn if you're not able to support your weight normally.\n\n### Step of the Dancing Moth (9**)\nWhile you are in this stance, you hover up to 5 feet in the air, though you otherwise move as though you were on the ground. You therefore ignore any ground-based hazards unless they can reach that high. If you fall, you'll \"Land\" 5 feet in the air, taking falling damage for a fall 5 feet shorter than the distance from where you fell to the ground.\n\n### Balance on the Sky (15***)\nWhile you are in this stance, so long as you have at least one hand free, you can walk on air as easily as the ground.

This increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level. Treat the claws as light weapons. In reality, you do not actually grow claws, but learn to scratch at your foes with devastating effect with your hands.\n\n### Marble Jaws\nAt 13th level, you gain a bite attack which does 1d10 points of damage initially and 1d12 at 19th level. You can use the bite attack in addition to an offhand attack as a single bonus action in order to engage in two-weapon fighting, or use the bite attack for your initial action and use both your hands to make light weapon attacks, which can be claw attacks. You can also initiate a Maneuvers  using the bite attack.\n\n### Granite Talons\nAt 17th level, you can use your feet to make claw attacks as well as your hands. You still need to stand on one foot unless you are flying, but you can use your action to make two attacks as normal with one hand or one foot or your bite, followed by a bonus action to use every other weapon you haven't attacked with yet, except the claw on the foot you're standing with.\n___\nFor example, you can make a bite attack twice, then three claw attacks, or a bite attack, two hand axe attacks and a claw attack. If you're flying, you can make another claw attack.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** Can I use a maul, drop it, make a claw attack, claim I've attacked with a light weapon, and make an offhand attack?\n___\n**A:** As written this kind of nonsense is possible for characters with extra attack in general.

The attack automatically hits objects (roll for a critical hit anyway). The attack, if it hits, deals an extra 1d6 points of damage times your highest Maneuvers  level, and damage it deals is true damage. True damage cannot be prevented, resisted or mitigated by any means. This means that you can break through  damage thresholds on objects.\n\n#### Stone Vise\n**2nd-level Stone Dragon**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 Round\n___\nYou make a single melee attack as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . The attack, if it hits, deals extra damage equal to 2d6, plus 1d6 for every 2 highest Maneuvers  levels after 2nd. The opponent must then take a constitution save: if they fail, their speed becomes 0 for one round.

If they are thrown into a creature, they stop and both creatures take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If they are thrown into a barrier, they either crash through or stop as appropriate, and take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage either way (or maybe piercing damage from a window).\n\n#### Wings of Stone\n**8th-level Stone Dragon**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 60 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a stone carved into the shape of a wing)\n\n**Duration:** 1 Round\n___\nYou form a chain of pure willpower, attach it to your weapon, and launch the weapon at a creature. If you are in the air, or the target is on the ground, or both, this simply allows you to make a melee weapon attack from 60 feet away. You pull on the chain after making the attack, hit or miss, and the weapon returns to your hand. Then the chain disintegrates.\n___\n\nHowever, if you are on the ground and your target is in the air, if struck, they are dragged to the ground. They can take a dexterity save to avoid falling damage, but are dragged to the ground nonetheless.

The Tiger Claw discipline teaches that martial superiority can be achieved by discarding the veneer of civilization, along with the higher thoughts that fetter a warrior\u2019s actions. Tiger Claw Maneuvers s emulate the strikes, leaps, and pounces of animals. When infused with ki power, some Tiger Claw Maneuvers s also allow a martial adept to take on animalistic characteristics, speed, and bloodlust.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Athletics\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Strength, Dexterity\n\n## Discipline Powers\n### Twin Claw Style\nWhen you choose this favoured discipline at 3rd level, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You add your ability modifier to the damage roll of your offhand weapon whenever you engage in two-weapon fighting.\n- Making an offhand weapon attack doesn't cost you your bonus action, though you can't then use your bonus action to do so again.\n- You can make as many offhand weapon attacks as you just made mainhand weapon attacks. Usually, this means that at 5th level, you can make two offhand weapon attacks and at 17th level (see Twin Claw Fury below) you can make three.\n\n### Twin Claw Shield\nWhen you reach 13th level, when you wield a light weapon in each hand, you get a +2 bonus to AC.\n\n### Twin Claw Fury\nWhen you reach 17th level, your fury with two weapons is exceptional. When you are wielding two light weapons, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You can make three attacks, not just two, when you take the attack action on your turn.\n- Whenever you hit with an attack, the minimum number you need to roll to achieve a critical hit with further attacks in the same turn decreases by 1. For example, if you hit five times, your sixth attack only needs a 15 or more to hit critically.\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Tiger Claw discipline.

Take an athletics check to jump, with a DC equal to your target's AC. If you succeed, make a melee attack with advantage which deals extra damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. Else, just make a melee attack. This is considered an attack action for purposes of two-weapon fighting.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Rapid Strike\n**2nd-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nEach attack you make this turn gets advantage on the attack roll and deals extra damage equal to 1d6 plus your highest Maneuvers  level.

If this attack hits, the target must take a constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take disadvantage on attack rolls and creatures have advantage on attack rolls against them for 3 rounds. Else, they take disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 round. This counts as an attack action for purposes of two-weapon fighting.\n\n#### Fountain of Blood\n**4th-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** 5 feet/30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous/1 round\n___\n\nYou can use this Maneuvers  whenever a creature within 5 feet of you falls to 0 hit points, including because you just attacked them.

You get an extra melee attack during that attack action and if you engage in two-weapon fighting this turn, you can make an extra melee attack during the two-weapon fighting bonus action. However, all your attacks this turn must be made against a single target.\n___\nYou don't get two extra offhand attacks if you use twin claw style, though: even though ordinarily you would get one extra because you just made an extra main-hand attack and one extra because of the effect of dancing mongoose, you just get the extra one offhand attack.\n___\nAt highest Maneuvers  level 8, you get two extra mainhand and two extra offhand melee attacks (but still don't get more than two extra offhand attacks with twin claw style).\n\n#### Pouncing Charge\n**5th-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nAs part of initiating this Maneuvers , you dash, and then take the attack action.

That creature takes damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. You then move into that creature's space without provoking attacks of opportunity. You have cover against all attacks while you are in this space, and any attack which only misses you because you have that cover must roll to hit your target instead.\n___\nThe creature can simply move away from you, but provokes an attack of opportunity when it leaves the space.\n\n#### Hamstring Attack\n**7th-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 minute/see text\n___\n\nYou make a single melee attack as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . If the attack hits, the target loses 1d8 points of dexterity and its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet for one minute. A constitution save halves both the dexterity loss and the movement speed reduction.\n___\nLost points of dexterity are restored at a rate of 1 per hour. The dexterity reduction increases to 1d10 at highest Maneuvers  level 8 and 1d12 at highest Maneuvers  level 9.\n\n#### Girallon Windmill Flesh Rip\n**8th-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou make an attack action as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . At the end of your turn, each creature you have hit with 2 or more attacks this turn (whether as part of the attack action of not) takes 8d6 points of true damage, plus another 2d6 per attack that hit that creature beyond the second. True damage cannot be prevented, resisted or mitigated by any means whatsoever, and applies even if your initial attacks dealt no damage.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Feral Death-Blow\n**9th-level Tiger Claw**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 5 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou leap onto an adjacent enemy, tearing them apart with savage blows. The target is reduced to 0 hit points and fails 2 death saves. A successful constitution save causes the target to instead take 20d6 points of slashing damage and, if this is enough to reduce the target to 0 hit points, they immediately fail 1 death save.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Tiger Claw discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of tiger claw Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of tiger claw Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 13** means you must know two tiger claw Maneuvers s and have reached 13th level.\n\n#### Blood in the Water (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, you get a cumulative +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls for each critical hit you score. The bonus resets to 0 if you go one minute without scoring any critical hits.\n\n#### Leaping Dragon Stance (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, you get a +10 bonus on athletics checks concerning jumping and all jumps you make are considered running jumps (you are considered to have moved at least 10 feet before the jump even if you didn't).\n\n#### Prey on the Weak (13**)\nWhile you are in this stance, you can make a free melee weapon attack against any creature within your reach any time an enemy within 10 feet of you falls unconscious.\n\n#### Wolf Pack Tactics (15**)\nWhile you are in this stance, every time you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can move 5 feet immediately without provoking attacks of opportunity. \n___\nThis can allow you to move further on your turn, or even to move to catch up with a creature you just made an attack of opportunity against - it works with any melee weapon attack, including ordinary attack action attacks, offhand attacks, attacks of opportunity, and melee attacks made as part of a Maneuvers .\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n\"Melee weapon attack\", for clarity, means a melee attack with a weapon, not just any attack with a melee weapon (conversely, whacking an enemy with a bow or stabbing them with an arrow counts).\n___\nThat said, there's no particular shame in taking the Nine Arrows as your favoured discipline-equivalent, and floating gently away from an enemy while filling them with arrows.\n\n# The White Raven\n___\n*\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?

When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, your allies get a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy or one round.\n\n### Murder of Crows\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to give up your turn to allow up to 2 of your allies in combat to take an extra turn instead.\n___\nYou use this ability when you are normally able to take a turn, and cannot use it if you can't take actions (but might use it if you are frightened or poisoned, say). The allies each take their extra turn immediately. Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\n___\nIf your allies are NPCs, or PCs who agree to you doing so, you can choose how they act on their extra turn (or at least advise them on how to act), so that using this ability isn't boring for you as a player!\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the White Raven discipline. To learn one, you must know at least one other white raven Maneuvers  per asterisk (*) after the level.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n##### 1st Level\nDouse the Flames, Lead the Attack\n\n##### 2nd Level*\nTactical Strike, War-Leader's Charge\n\n##### 3rd Level*\nRaven's Cry, White Raven Tactics\n\n##### 4th Level*\nWhite Raven Strike\n\n##### 5th Level**\nBirds of a Feather\n\n##### 6th Level**\nOrder Forged from Chaos\n\n##### 7th Level***\nClarion Call, Flock Together\n\n##### 8th Level***\nAngel's Wings\n\n##### 9th Level****\nWar-Master's Charge\n\n#### Douse The Flames\n**1st-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a drop of water)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\n\nYou make a melee attack as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . If the attack hits, the creature struck can't make opportunity attacks for one round. This increases by one per 2 highest Maneuvers  levels after 1st.\n\n#### Lead the Attack\n**1st-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nAs part of the initiation of this Maneuvers , you make a melee attack. If the attack hits, creatures have advantage on attack rolls against the creature you hit for 1 round.\n\n#### Tactical Strike\n**2nd-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen you initiate this Maneuvers , make a melee attack. If the attack hits, it deals 2d6 points of damage, and your allies within 5 feet of the target (including you, if you are) each move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n#### War-Leader's Charge\n**2nd-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nAs part of this Maneuvers , you dash and make a single melee attack. If you move at least 10 feet before making the attack, it deals extra damage equal to 1d6, plus 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Raven's Cry\n**3rd-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action (see text)\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a feather)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\n\nWhen you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can initiate this Maneuvers  as a bonus action on the same turn. When you do, you give each ally within 30 feet a bonus on damage rolls equal to your highest Maneuvers  level plus 1 for 1 round.\n\n#### White Raven Tactics\n**3rd-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of cloth from a flag)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou choose one ally within range with a different initiative count from you. Whichever of you has the lower initiative count rises to the other's initiative count, and acts just after them each round. If the ally has a lower initiative count than you, they will therefore act immediately after you. If you have a lower initiative count than them, you will take your turn earlier in subsequent rounds, but not this one.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** What if I houserule that we roll initiative every round?\n___\n**A:** In that case, change White Raven Tactics' effect to read:\n___\n\"You choose one ally within range. If that creature has a lower initiative count than you this round, they are moved to your initiative count, and act directly after you. In any case, for the rest of the combat, when initiative is rolled, whichever of you and the target rolls lower acts at the other's initiative count. \nIf you target multiple different creatures during a combat, you and all of them move to the highest initiative count among those creatures and you each round.\"\n___\n**Q:** Can I use White Raven Tactics to get extra turns?\n___\n**A:** You shouldn't be able to - the only things it can now do are make a creature who hasn't acted yet have an initiative slightly below yours, or change your initiative count on the next turn. At best, you can take two turns nearly in a row, but that only makes up for a bad initiative roll. You should assume that any way you find to take extra turns with White Raven Tactics doesn't work.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### White Raven Strike\n**4th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\n\nAs part of the initiation of this Maneuvers , you make a melee attack. If it hits, you deal extra damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level, the target's dexterity modifier is treated as 0 (unless it is already lower) when determining their AC for 1 round, and attacks against them have advantage for one round.\n\n#### Birds of a Feather\n**5th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nTo use this Maneuvers , you must have at least one ally positioned such that you and they are on opposite sides of a creature in both of your melee reaches. You make a melee attack as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . That creature can also make a melee attack. Then, any other pair of allies who are on opposite sides of the target can attack, and any ally who is on the opposite side from an ally who can already attack can attack.\n___\nConsider two creatures to be \"Opposite\" the target if a line drawn between the centre of the two creatures passes through (not just touches) the target's space. For a medium target, this means that a creature can stand directly opposite you or in one of the squares next to it.\n___\n(Another way to visualise this is to suppose that you walked up to the target (if you're more than 5 feet away) and fired a cone effect directly at the target. If the cone effect would hit your ally and they are not on the very edge of the effect, they are opposite the target.)\n\n#### Order Forged From Chaos\n**6th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** Your movement\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a small symbol consisting of a circle, an arrow, and five broken points.)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou initiate this Maneuvers  by giving up your movement rather than taking any actions. Instead, all your allies can immediately move as though it were their turn.\n___\nThis movement is just normal movement, so it still provokes opportunity attacks as normal. Further, it doesn't count towards fulfilling the movement requirements of any special abilities that the target might have (though it's still subject to any restrictions that might be placed on their movement, and the movement still ends most stone dragon stances if they move more than 5 feet). \n\n#### Clarion Call\n**7th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action (see text)\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a feather and a figurine of a horn)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can initiate this Maneuvers  as a bonus action on the same turn. Each ally within range - including you - can either move as though it were their turn (see Order Forged from Chaos, above), or make a single attack, immediately.\n\n\n#### Flock Together\n**7th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen you use this Maneuvers , you make a single melee attack. Hit or miss, every other creature in range to make a melee attack against the target can do so.\n\n#### Angel's Wings\n**8th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nAngelic wings burst from your back, and a swarm of feathers spins around your allies. A moment later, they are elsewhere. You, and each ally in range, immediately teleports anywhere else in range.\n\n#### War-Master's Charge\n**9th-level White Raven**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou raise your weapon high into the air and shout a valiant war-cry before leading your allies onwards to victory. You take the dash action as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers , but you must then immediately use your movement to move close enough to make a melee weapon attack against a creature (if the extra movement from dashing isn't enough to do this, you can't initiate this Maneuvers ). You then immediately make a melee attack, and your attack deals an extra 16d6 points of damage if it hits.\n___\nAny number of creatures within 30 feet of you when you initiate the Maneuvers  can immediately move up to double their movement speed and make a melee weapon attack against the same target, if they're in range to do so.\n___\nIf your favoured discipline is Nine Arrows, you and other creatures can make ranged weapon attacks instead, but anyone who chooses to do so cannot dash or move due to this Maneuvers 's effects (you can't dash, others can't move at all).\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the White Raven discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of white raven Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum lpevel and a number of asterisks equal to the number of white raven Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two white raven Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n\n#### Bolstering Presence (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, allies within 60 feet of you (including yourself) get a +2 bonus on wisdom saves and another +2 bonus (which stacks) on any type of save against a fear-related effect.\n\n#### Leading the Charge (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, any creature within 60 feet of you (including yourself) who moves into an enemy's reach and makes a melee attack against them deals additional damage equal to double your highest Maneuvers  level.\n___\nIf your primary discipline is Nine Arrows, you and other creatures also get this benefit if they move out of an enemy's reach and make a ranged attack against that creature (or if they run up to a creature and shoot it in the face, as per the standard benefit of Clear Skies Initiate).\n\n#### Pack Tactics (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, all creatures deal additional damage with any attack against one of your enemies within your reach equal to the number of its enemies in whose reach that creature is, including you. That is, any enemy you can reach takes additional damage from all attacks equal to the number of its enemies who can reach it, including you.\n\n#### Press the Advantage (9**)\nWhile you are in this stance, once per round you can move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity, in addition to (and perhaps even during) your normal movement.\n\n#### Swarm Tactics (15***)\nWhile you are in this stance, all creatures within 60 feet *except* for yourself have advantage on attack rolls against any enemy you are adjacent to.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** Some of the White Raven Maneuvers s and stances (Lead the Attack, White Raven Strike, Flock Together, War-Master's Charge, Leading the Charge, Pack Tactics and Swarm Tactics) are written very deliberately to give your enemies benefits against the target of the ability, as well as your allies. Can you exclude a creature from the effect?\n___\n**A:** No. These effects represent creating an opening, weakening a foe, or using weight of numbers to crush them. You can't prevent an enemy from taking advantage of a weakness you've opened in another enemy - and you'll very rarely want to anyway. On the plus side, most of these effects are actually extremely powerful in a multi-way brawl exactly because your other enemies can and will take advantage of them - and probably attack your enemies and not you!\n\n# Multiclass Initiators\n\nIt is not uncommon for crusaders, swordsages and warblades to mix their martial talents together. It is not unheard of for members of other classes to attempt to take up the way of the nine swords. However, it is a difficult and arduous path to take. To enter the crusader class, one must have a constitution and charisma of at least 13": null, " for swordsage, a dexterity and wisdom of at least 13": null, " would-be-warblades must have a strength and intelligence of at least 13. Entering any of these classes only confers the class's proficiency in light armour, simple weapons, and martial melee weapons, not any other proficiency the class grants.\n___\nAs far as Maneuvers s are concerned, when you take two different initiator classes, treat the number of Maneuvers s readied in the second class as being 0 at first level, and reduced by the same amount at each level thereafter (so effectively, your number of Maneuvers s readied is reduced by the number you can usually ready at first level). Similarly, reduce the number of stances known by 1. Finally, reduce the number of Maneuvers s known at each level so that you only earn 1 at first level.\n___\nAll told, this means that you reduce the Maneuvers s known, Maneuvers s readied and stances known by 4, 5, 1 for crusader, 5, 4, 1 for swordsage and 2, 3, 1 for warblade.\n___\nEach time you learn a Maneuvers , it must be one from the class you're learning it from. However, its maximum level is calculated by combining the levels of both initiator classes (so a swordsage 6/warblade 5 can use 6th-level Maneuvers s just like a swordsage 11 can).\n___\nYou do not choose another favoured discipline at 3rd level in one initiating class if you've already reached 3rd level in another, but levels in the new class count as levels in the old for determining the effect of your favoured discipline, even if the new class can't favour that discipline.\n___\nEvery 2 levels in a class which is *not* crusader, swordsage or warblade count as one level in a class that *is* crusader, swordsage or warblade for the purpose of determining the highest level of Maneuvers s you can learn and which stances you can learn. If you take a subclass which allows you to initiate Maneuvers s, you must reduce the number of Maneuvers s known, Maneuvers s readied and stances known in your second class, as above.\n___\nFinally, Maneuvers s and regular spellcasting don't mix: each advances separately, and you can't ready or initiate your spells or prepare or cast your Maneuvers s. If you are a multiclass spellcaster and your favoured discipline is Jade Ph\u0153nix or Ruby Knight, count any levels in crusader, swordsage and warblade as levels in Eldritch Knight for determining your available spell slots.\n___\n\nTherefore, a Jade Ph\u0153nix Swordsage 5/Warblade 4/Wizard 10 has a multiclass caster level of 13 and a multiclass initiator level of 14.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# Variant Multiclass\n\nVariant multiclass is a system by which each class has a variant multiclass archetype that can be used for most classes other than that class. In particular, the rules here can be used to variant multiclass with crusader, swordsage, or warblade with no alteration if you are a barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock or wizard. \n___\nRather than actually taking multiclass levels in the class in question, it replaces - or, rather, is - your primal path, bard college, divine domain, druidic circle, martial archetype, monastic tradition, sacred oath, ranger archetype, rogue archetype, sorcerous origin, otherworldly patron or arcane tradition. The restrictions are as follows:\n\n- You cannot take a variant multiclass archetype if you have any levels in that class.\n- You cannot take levels in a class if you are already a variant multiclass member of that class.\n- You cannot take a variant multiclass archetype in two different classses.\n\nEssentially, you can only multiclass as a particular class once, irrespective of the type of multiclassing or order of operations. In general, it's probably inadvisable to mix standard and variant multiclassing.\n___\nAll classes get similar benefits from becoming a variant multiclass member of a class - it's for the player to decide, as with regular multiclassing, whether or not a particular combination is worth it - but there are slight differences in who gets what, and they get them at different times in accordance with the usual timings for their abilities.\n\n#### Variant Multiclassing for Initiators\n\nIf you have levels in an initiator class and wish to take a variant multiclass subclass, you refer to the benefits that the variant multiclass archetype grants a rogue, reading any instance of \"9\" as \"13\".\n___\nIf you wish to take rogue as your variant multiclass archetype, you get bonus skills, thieves' cant and sneak attack immediately, expertise and uncanny dodge at 13th level, and reliable talent and blindsense at 17th level.\n___\nNote that these features don't all do the same thing for you that they do for the rogue": null, " see the variant multiclass rogue itself for details.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** Why rogue?\n___\n**A:** Mainly, the fact that it has an archetype feature on levels 3, 13 and 17, just like you. It's easier to shunt any features the rogue would have got at 9th level to 13th than to remember a different rule for each of the three initiators depending on what they're most similar to, and also remember what happens when you actually want to multiclass them with the similar class each time.\n\n## Variant Multiclass: Crusader\nCrusader features are gained at the given levels:\n\n|Feature|Brb|Brd|Clr|Drd|Fgt|Mnk|Pal|Rgr|Rog|Sor|Wlk|Wiz\n|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n|Divine Inspiration|\u2015|\u2015|2|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|3|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015\n|Sacred Spells|\u2015|\u2015|1|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|3|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|1|\u2015\n|Maneuvers s|3|3|1|2|3|3|3|3|3|1|1|2\n|Stance|3|3|8|10|3*|3|3|3|3|14|10|10\n|Steely Resolve|3|3|2|2|3|3|3|3|3|6|6|6\n|Smite|6|6|6|6|7|6|7|7|9|6|6|6\n|Die Hard|10|14|14|10|10|11|15|11|13**|18|14|14\n|Mettle|14|14|17|14|15|17|15|15|17|18|\u2015|\u2015\n|Double Strike|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|20|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015|\u2015\n\n*And another stance at 18th level.\n\n**Warblade gets Zealous Surge instead.\n\n### Divine Inspiration\nBy channeling divinity as a bonus action, you can choose a withheld Maneuvers  and have it become granted.\n\n### Sacred Spells\nYour domain, oath or pact spells are:\n\n**1st:** Compelled Duel, Wrathful Smite\n\n**2nd:** Magic Weapon, Spiritual Weapon\n\n**3rd:** Beacon of Hope, Crusader's Mantle\n\n**4th:** Aura of Purity, Guardian of Faith\n\n**5th:** Banishing Smite, Circle of Power\n\n### Maneuvers s\nYou have a limited ability to learn and initiate Maneuvers s.

As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\n### Extra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\n### Smite\nFrom 6th level, once per turn, when you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can expend a Maneuvers  to deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage, times your highest Maneuvers  level, to the target rather than using the Maneuvers  normally.\n\n### Zealous Surge\nFrom 9th level, you can re-roll a saving throw. This ability does not require an action. You simply decide to use it after seeing the result of your saving throw roll but before the DM tells you if it fails or succeeds. Once you use this ability, you must complete a long rest to use it again.\n\n### Die Hard\nFrom 10th level, when you fall unconscious, you automatically become stable and don't need to take death saves - though attacking you while unconscious or abilities which kill you outright can still kill you.\n\n### Mettle\nFrom 14th level, whenever you take a constitution or wisdom save for half damage, instead you take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful save.\n\n### Double Strike\nAt 20th level, when you initiate a Maneuvers  which affects your next attack, it affects both of the attacks in your next attack action. When you initiate a Maneuvers  which has you make a weapon attack as part of the effect, you attack twice and the effects apply to both attacks.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Swordsage\n\nA master of martial Maneuvers s, the sword sage is a physical adept \u2014 a blade wizard whose knowledge of the Sublime Way lets them unlock potent abilities, many of which are overtly supernatural or magical in nature. Depending on which disciplines they choose to study, a swordsage might be capable of walking through walls, leaping dozens of feet into the air, shattering boulders with a single touch, or even mastering the elements of fire or shadow. Whatever their specific training, a swordsage blurs the line between martial prowess and magical skill.\n\n## Hit Points\n\n**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per swordsage level.\n___\n**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier.\n___\n**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifer for each swordsage level after 1st.\n\n## Proficiencies\n\n**Armour:** Light armour\n___\n**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial melee weapons (icluding thrown weapons)\n___\n**Tools:** None\n___\n**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Strength\n___\n**Skills:** Choose three from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Arcana, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Stealth and Survival\n___\n\n## Equipment\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n\n- *(a)* a two-handed martial melee weapon or *(b)* a light martial melee weapon and versatile martial melee weapon\n- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon\n- *(a)* a dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack\n- Leather armour and an arcane focus\n\n## Class Features\nAs a swordsage, you gain the following class features:\n\n### Maneuvers s\nFrom 1st level, you can use a variety of special spells known as Maneuvers s which follow different rules to normal spells.\n\n#### Learning Maneuvers s\nYou begin with knowledge of six martial Maneuvers s, which come from any of the Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon, and Tiger Claw lists.\n\n<div class": "'wide'>\n\n##### The Swordsage\n| Level | Proficiency Bonus | Features | Maneuvers s Known | Maneuvers s Readied | Stances Known | \n|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 1st | +2 | Quick to Act, Weapon Focus | 6 (1st) | 4  | 1 \n| 2nd | +2 | Light Armour Specialist | 7 (1st) | 4  | 2\n| 3rd | +2 | Favoured Discipline | 8 (2nd) | 5 | 2\n| 4th | +2 | Ability Score Improvement, | 9 (2nd) | 5 | 2\n| 5th | +3 | Extra Attack | 10 (3rd) | 6  | 3\n| 6th | +3 | Sense Magic | 11 (3rd) | 6  | 3\n| 7th | +3 | Insightful Strike | 12 (4th) | 6  | 3\n| 8th | +3 | Ability Score Improvement | 13 (4th) | 7  | 3\n| 9th | +4 | Evasion | 14 (5th) | 7  | 4\n| 10th | +4 | Secondary Discipline Skill | 15 (5th) | 8 | 4\n| 11th | +4 | Defensive Stance | 16 (6th) | 8 | 4\n| 12th | +4 | Ability Score Improvement | 17 (6th) | 8 | 4\n| 13th | +5 | Favoured Discipline Feature | 18 (7th) | 9 | 5\n| 14th | +5 | Secondary Discipline Insight | 19 (7th) | 9 | 5\n| 15th | +5 |  | 20 (8th) | 10 | 5\n| 16th | +5 | Ability Score Improvement | 21(8th) | 10 | 5\n| 17th | +6 | Favoured Discipline Feature | 22 (9th) | 10 | 5\n| 18th | +6 | Secondary Discipline Defence | 23 (9th) | 11 | 5\n| 19th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement | 24 (9th) | 11 | 5\n| 20th | +6 | Dual Boost | 25 (9th) | 12 | 6\n</div>\n\n(You can pick each Maneuvers  from a different list", " else, it continues straight in the direction it last moved (straight away from the section just behind the head).\n___\nA creature who moves into the firesnake for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes fire damage equal to 1d8 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Searing Blade\n**4th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYour melee attacks deal extra fire damage equal to 2d6, plus your highest Maneuvers  level.\n___\n#### Searing Charge\n**4th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A charred feather)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou gain the ability to fly at twice your base land speed, and the first attack you make this round does extra fire damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Leaping Flame\n**5th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** 100 ft\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou immediately teleport to any space within range which is adjacent to a creature who just attacked you.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Desert Tempest\n**6th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A handful of sand)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nThis turn, when you move out of a square adjacent to an enemy, you can attack that enemy. You get no special ability to avoid opportunity attacks, though! You can only attack each enemy once per round in this way.\n\n#### Ring of Fire\n**6th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute, or until discharged\n___\nYou raise your weapon up to the sky, and at the tip, a fiery trail begins. You immediately dash as part of the initiation. Whenever you move during the duration, make a note of your trail. If that trail crosses its own path at any point, the Maneuvers  ends immediately but the ring of fire completes - every creature within the area enclosed by the trail, including creatures on one of the squares occupied by part of the trail that is enclosing the area but excluding you, takes fire damage equal to 2d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Salamander Charge \n**7th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A charred feather)\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds, see text\n___\nYou dash as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . When you move this turn, a shimmering wall of fire appears behind you, occupying every space you move through. The wall lasts for as long as you concentrate. When the wall is created, each creature within 5 feet of the wall takes fire damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. Each creature who is actually in the wall takes that much damage again. Each time, a successful dexterity save halves the damage.\n\nThis damage is also dealt to a creature when it approaches within 5 feet of the wall for the first time each turn or starts its turn there, and when it enters the wall for the first time or starts its turn there. Essentially, a creature who is actually in the wall at any point in its turn takes the damage twice.\n\n#### Inferno Blast\n**9th-level Desert Wind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 60 ft radius burst centred on you.\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (brimstone)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWith a loud shout, you slam your weapon into the ground and focus your ki into a blast of white-hot fire that does 100 points of fire damage to each other creature within 60 feet.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Desert Wind discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of desert wind Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of desert wind Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 5* means you must know one desert wind Maneuvers  and have reached 5th level.\n\n#### Flame's Blessing (1)\nYou are resistant to fire while in this stance. From 16th level, you are immune to fire while in this stance.\n\n#### Cloak of Calamity (5*)\nYou channel your inner disrespect for the victims of fires before yours and wear it as armour against those who would oppose you. Whenever an adjacent opponent hits you with a melee attack, they take 5 points of fire damage.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Why did you rename...\n___\n**A:** Let me stop you right there. Yes, I know technically the word literally means any total burning of something, but it usually refers to a historical event which...\n___\n**Q:** You mean a historical event like the Crusades?\n___\n**A:** Ignoring the difference between living memory and medi\u00e6val history, crusade is probably more commonly used to mean any militaristic action of percieved righteousness (\"Will you join in our crusade, will you take your place with me? Beyond the barricade is there a place you long to see?\") than the actual Crusades. Oh, and if I renamed the crusader, it would throw everyone off - everyone remembers that the initiators are swordsage, warblade and crusader, not zealot.\n___\n**Q:** So what was wrong with \"Wyrm's Breath\" then?\n___\n**A:** It was boring and we have upcasting now. You'll notice it also does a totally different thing. That's why a lot of the \"Such and such only better\" Maneuvers s are gone or do different things from they used to.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Rising Phoenix (15***)\nA column of superheated air lifts you up as though you had been reborn from your own ashes. While you are in this stance, you can fly as fast as you can walk, and can hover, but you can only actually float 10 feet in the air above a solid or liquid surface (though that's not to say that the surface has to be able to support your weight). If you ever aren't within 10 feet of such a surface, the stance ends, which will usually drop you down to the ground below (though if on any of your turns you are up to 10 feet above the ground, you can enter the stance again to save yourself and are very lucky).\n\nWhenever you take the attack action, the column bursts into flame, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to any creature within 5 feet of the column of air except for you (the column occupies your space, and each of the spaces directly between you and the surface below).\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Devoted Spirit\n___\n*\"Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light\"*\n\n*\u2014 Helen Keller*\n#\nF - aith, piety, and purity of body and mind are the wellsprings of a warrior\u2019s true power. Devoted Spirit Maneuvers s harness a practitioner\u2019s spiritual strength and her zealous devotion to a cause. This discipline includes energies baneful to a creature opposed to the Devoted Spirit student\u2019s cause, abilities that can keep an adept fighting long after a more mundane warrior would fall to his enemies, and strikes infused with vengeful, fanatical power.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Intimidation\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Constitution, Charisma\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Opportune Moment\nWhen you take this favoured discipline at 3rd level, you gain the ability to take a opportunty attack once per round without using your reaction to do so.\n\n### Aura of Thorns\nStarting from 13th level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal half as much damage back to the attacker. Apply your resistance or vulnerability to the damage, not theirs (suppose a creature who is resistant to slashing rolls 10 slashing damage against you while you're vulnerable to slashing. You take 20 damage, so the creature takes 10).\n\n### Zeal and Fury\nFrom 17th level, you put your weight into your attacks while using your force of personality to guide your weapon. The first time you hit an enemy with a melee weapon attack in a round, the attack deals extra damage equal to your constitution modifier **times** your charisma modifier. Use the absolute value of each, to a minimum of 1 - if one of these ability scores slips below 8, this means that you actually start landing stronger and stronger blows in your desperation!\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** What does \"Absolute value\" mean?\n___\n**A:** The abolute value of a positive number equals that number. The absolute value of a negative number equals that number, times -1 -  the absolute values of 2 and -2 are both 2.\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Devoted Spirit discipline. To learn one, you must know at least one other devoted spirit Maneuvers  per asterisk (*) after the level.\n\n##### 1st Level\nEntangling Blade (Ensnaring Strike), Revitalising Strike, Vanguard Strike (Guiding Bolt)\n\n##### 2nd Level\nFoehammer, Shield Block,\n\n##### 3rd Level*\nDefensive Rebuke\n\n##### 4th Level*\nDivine Surge\n\n##### 5th Level*\nDaunting Strike, Zealous Charge\n\n##### 6th Level**\nRallying Strike\n\n##### 7th Level**\nCastigating Strike, Shield Counter\n\n##### 8th Level**\nSacrificial Divine Surge\n\n##### 9th Level***\nStrike of Righteous Vitality\n\n#### Revitalising Strike\n**1st-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self/10 feet\n\n**Components:** V, M (A tiny piece of a flag)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment which is not exactly identical to yours and who poses a threat to you or your allies in a direct, immediate way, you or an ally within 10 feet is healed for 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level, plus your initiating ability modifier.\n#### Foehammer\n**2nd-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits, it does additional damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. Further, damage the attack deals is true damage instead of damage of its original type - true damage cannot be prevented, mitigated or resisted by any means whatsoever.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Shield Block\n**2nd-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** 5 feet\n\n**Components:** S, M (A statuette of a shield)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen an enemy attacks an adjacent ally while you wield a shield, you can initiate this Maneuvers  to reduce the attack roll by 4, plus your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Defensive Rebuke\n**3rd-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** S, M (a thorn)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nFor 1 round, you gain the ability to draw the aggression of your enemies. Each enemy you hit while this Maneuvers  is active provokes an opportunity attack from you for every single attack they make which targets one of your allies (other than you), and these extra opportunity attacks do not use up your reaction. These enemies are aware of the consequences of attacking your allies due to this ability.\n\n#### Divine Surge\n**4th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack which deals additional damage equal to 2d8, plus 1d8 times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Daunting Strike\n**5th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a snarling face carved in wood)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou make a melee attack as part of this Maneuvers . If you hit, the enemy must take a wisdom save or be frightened of you for one round.\n\n#### Zealous Charge\n**5th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A page from a holy text)\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\nYou dash as part of this Maneuvers . Your next melee attack channels divine fury. If you are good and the target is evil or vice versa, or lawful neutral and the target is chaotic, or chaotic neutral and the target is lawful, or true neutral and the target is neutral on neither axis, the attack deals extra damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level and you get resistance to damage for 1 round.\n\n#### Rallying Strike\n**6th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self/30 feet\n\n**Components:** V, M (A piece of a flag)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment which is not exactly identical to yours and who poses a threat to you or your allies in a direct, immediate way, you and all allies within 30 feet are healed for 1d6 times (your highest Maneuvers  level, minus 3) - initially 3d6 - plus your initiating ability modifier.\n\n#### Castigating Strike\n**7th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** See text\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment that is not exactly identical to yours, the target takes radiant damage equal to 1d6 times your highest Maneuvers  level. Each other enemy within 30 feet takes 3d6 less damage and takes a constitution save for half damage. The initial target also takes a constitution save. Each creature who fails has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n**Q:** Do unaligned creatures have an alignment which is not exactly identical to mine?\n___\n**A:** No. They do not have an alignment at all.\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Shield Counter\n**7th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Your reach\n\n**Components:** V, M (A statuette of a knight with a shield)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen an enemy within reach attacks an ally, but before they roll to hit, you can use this Maneuvers  to whack them with your shield (if you're wielding one). Treat the shield as a mace. If you hit the enemy, their attack automatically misses.\n\n#### Sacrificial Divine Surge\n**8th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou lose a positive whole number of points of constitution of your choice, then make a melee attack which deals an extra 8d6 points of damage, or 10d6 if your highest Maneuvers  level is 9th. For each point of constitution you lose, you get a +1 bonus to the attack roll and deal another 2d6 points of damage.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\nLost points of constitution that you accept in this way are automatically restored at a rate of one per hour.\n\n#### Strike of Righteous Vitality\n**9th-level Devoted Spirit**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** See text\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nIf your next melee attack this round hits a creature with an alignment which is not exactly identical to yours and who poses a threat to you or your allies in a direct, immediate way, you or an ally within 10 feet is healed for 100 hit points, and any disease affecting them is cured, along with the blinded and deafened conditions.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Devoted Spirit discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of devoted spirit Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of devoted spirit Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 11** means you must know two devoted spirit Maneuvers s and have reached 11th level.\n\n#### Iron Guard's Glare (1)\nYour steely gaze causes even the most resolute of foes to have trouble looking away to attack your allies.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, enemies within your reach have disadvantage on attack rolls against your allies (other than you), though they are aware of this.\n\n#### Martial Spirit (1)\nYour lust for battle is infectious, inspiring your allies to keep fighting despite - or perhaps even because of - their wounds.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, whenever you hit an enemy who poses a genuine threat to you with a melee attack, you or an ally within 30 feet is healed for 2 points of damage.\n\n#### Thicket of Blades (5*)\nYour weapon is held ready to strike any creature who makes even the slightest movement.\n___\nWhile you are in this stance, your enemies can't avoid provoking opportunity attacks from you by taking the disengage action. Further, an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you when they move out of any square you can reach, not just out of your reach entirely.\n\n#### Aura of Zeal (11**)\nYou fill yourself with righteous indignation or vile pride, empowering yourself to become the embodiment of the alignment you stand for. \n___\nWhile you are in this stance, you gain two of the following benefits based on your alignment:\n\n- **Chaotic:** Whenever you roll the maximum result on a damage die, treat it as double its actual result (so when you wield a greatsword, each d6 can roll 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 12).\n- **Lawful:** When you make any roll, you can choose to use your passive result plus 1.\n- **Neither:** Once per round, instead of rolling a d20 roll, you can roll 2+((1d2-1)*17) instead (that is, flip a coin: heads is 19, tails is 2).\n- **Good:** Whenever you or an ally within 10 feet hits an evil creature with a melee weapon attack, the attacker heals 2d6 hit points.\n\n- **Evil:** Whenever a good creature hits you or an ally within 10 feet with a melee weapon attack, the attacker takes 2d6 points of necrotic damage.\n- **Neither:** You get both of the above benefits, but the damage or healing is only 1d6 points.\n\n#### Immortal Fortitude (15***)\nDespite the horrific wounds you suffer, the flash of searing spells, and the crash of a foe's mighty attacks, you stand resolute on the field. So long as the potential for victory exists, you fight on.\n___\nWhile in this stance, if you take enough damage to reduce you to 0 hit points, calculate the damage you have taken beyond enough to reduce you to 0 (essentially, the number of hit points below 0 the damage would reduce you to if that were possible). Take a constitution save with a DC equal to half of that value. If you pass, you do not fall unconscious, and instead, you are reduced to 1 hit point, instead of 0.\n___\nRelying on this power is dangerous, however. Each time you successfully save yourself from unconsciousness with this stance, mark a single failed death save on yourself even though you are still conscious. This failed death save lasts until you leave this stance. If you really are knocked unconscious, you start rolling for further death saves as normal.\n___\nIf you pass a third constitution save, you don't die instantly despite having three failed death saves marked on you, but you can't attempt to save yourself from unconsciouness while you have three failed death saves on you, so you will need to leave the stance and enter it again. If you are reduced to 0 hit points a fourth time, you will die outright because you have three failed death saves.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Does Thicket of Blades allow me to make more than one opportunity attack in a round? What if I also use Defensive Rebuke?\n___\n**A:** No. Defensive Rebuke only allows you to make its own opportunity attacks for free, not opportunity attacks in general or the ones that Thicket of Blades provides you. If you use both, you can take one attack for each time an enemy attacks an ally, plus one more total for either thicket of blades' effect or a standard oppotunity attack\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Diamond Mind\n___\n*\"An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded.\"*\n\n*\u2014 Isador Akios*, Dawn of War\n#\nTrue quickness lies in the mind, not the body. A student of the Diamond Mind discipline seeks to hone his perceptions and discipline his thoughts so that he can act in slivers of time so narrow that others cannot even perceive them. A corollary of this speed of thought and action is the concept of the mind as the battleground. An enemy defeated in his mind must inevitably be defeated in the realm of the physical as well.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Investigation\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Strength, Intelligence\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Clock of Perfect Quartz\nWhen you take this favoured discipline at 3rd level, you can take an investigation check instead of a constitution save to maintain concentration on a Maneuvers .\n\n### Malachite Ph\u0153nix Shield\nFrom 13th level, your physical strength and mental resolve allow you to tap into the powers of life and rebirth. Any damage you would take is reduced by your strength modifier + your intelligence modifier.\n\n### Strike of Obsidian Shards\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to perform a special attack called a strike of obsidian shards, by slamming your weapon so hard into the ground that it shatters into pieces, striking every opponent within your choice of a 60 foot line, a 30 foot cone, or a 10 foot radius burst centred on you. Your sheer force of will guides the shards unerringly into your foes, with no chance for them to avoid the attack, and around your allies, automatically missing them, and once the strike of obsidian shards is completed, your weapon reforms in your hand, undamaged by the attack.\n___\nHowever, the true power of the strike of obsidian shards is that it can replace any melee attack, applying any bonus effect to every single hit you land with the attack as well as doing normal weapon damage. This includes the melee attack made as part of a Maneuvers .\n___\nOnce you have used the strike of obsidian shards, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.\n\n___\n___\n___\n___\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Diamond Mind discipline.

The attack also deals extra damage, though it only does half as much if the save is passed - as your highest Maneuvers  level increases, the nightmare blade changes in power and appearance:\n\n- **1st: Sapphire:** 1d6 points of cold damage.\n- **2nd: Peridot:** 1d8 points of acid damage.\n- **3rd: Amber:** 1d10 points of lightning damage.\n- **4th: Ruby:** 2d6 points of fire damage.\n- **5th: Topaz:** 2d8 points of thunder damage\n- **6th: Malachite:** 2d10 points of poison damage.\n- **7th: Amethyst:** 4d6 points of psychic damage\n- **8th: Diamond:** 4d8 points of force damage.\n- **9th: Obsidian** 4d10 points of necrotic damage\n___\nThese effects are cumulative, so an obsidian nightmare blade deals a total of 7d10+7d8+7d6 extra damage.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n#### Onyx Mind\n**1st-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a black glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou focus your mind to gain advantage on a wisdom or charisma save and you are always considered proficient.\n\n#### Aquamarine Flow\n**2nd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a blue glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour mind and body alike flow faster. You gain advantage on an intelligence or dexterity save and are treated as proficient.\n\n#### Emerald Razor\n**2nd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a green glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour blade glows green like an emerald, and carves straight through armour. You make a single attack against an enemy, replacing the static part of your opponent's listed AC with 10 and ignoring any shield they're wielding. For example, normally, a creature with studded leather armour would have an AC of 12 + their dexterity modifier. You treat it as 10 + their dexterity modifier. A creature with plate armour and a shield would normally have an AC of 20, but you treat it as 10. You also ignore any effect which sets someone's AC to a certain value or minimum (like mage armour or barkskin) or gives a static bonus to it (like shield).\n\n#### Opal Armour\n**3rd-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a mutlicoloured glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYour body and mind harden.

In this case, you don't add your strength modifier to the damage. You usually do damage equal to 1d20 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier.\n\n#### Bounding Assault\n\n**4th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round.\n___\nYou dash as part of the initiation of this Maneuvers . You get advantage on melee attack rolls this turn.\n\n#### Mind Strike\n\n**4th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou attempt to bring your weapon down on an enemy's head. You make an attack, and if it hits, the target loses 1d4 points of wisdom. A successful wisdom save halves the reduction. Lost wisdom points are restored at a rate of 1 per hour.\n\n#### Rapid Counter\n\n**5th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** None!\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou immediately take an opportunity attack against a creature who has just provoked one. You can then use your reaction to make an actual opportunity attack as well, if you still have your reaction, or you can save it for something else.\n\n#### Moment of Alacrity\n\n**6th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nThis Maneuvers  initially does nothing, but at the start of the next round, your initiative count increases by 20 for the rest of the encounter, usually meaning that you'll go first.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** What does Moment of Alacrity do if I houserule that we roll initiative each round?\n___\n**A:** Change the text of Moment of Alacrity to read \"This Maneuvers  gives a +20 bonus to the initiative rolls for the rest of the combat.\" However, its duration is still instantaneous, so it can't be dispelled to remove the +20.\n___\n**Q:** Does Moment of Alacrity stack with itself?\n___\n**A:** Technically no, functionally yes. It's a bit like asking if two fireballs stack. Your initiative will increase by 20, and then by 20 again, so the answer to the question you're really asking is \"yes\". The altered version to handle people's houserules doesn't, as written, stack with itself, but any DM who writes houserules has their own opinion of whether or not it should.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** Moving on, what happens if I use an ability like nightmare blade while using Garnet or Moonstone Strike?\n___\n**A:** Garnet and Moonstone Strike only replace the weapon damage and your strength modifier. So Garnet Strike + Amber Nightmare Blade ": "1d20 + 1d10 + 1d8 + 1d6 + proficiency + intelligence.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Moonstone Strike\n**6th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (A white glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n___\nFor the duration, whenever you hit with a melee attack, you can roll a two investigation checks and add them together instead of the weapon's normal damage roll and use that instead. In this case, you don't add your strength modifier to the damage. Essentially, you usually do damage equal to 2d20 + twice your proficiency bonus + twice your intelligence modifier.\n\n#### Avalanche of Blades\n\n**7th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make an attack action as part of initiating this Maneuvers . You get advantage on each attack, and if the attack hits, you can make another attack without advantage, and if that attack also hits, you can make yet another attack, this one with disadvantage. If you make an attack with an offhand weapon this turn, you can do the same with that weapon as well.\n\n#### Aquamarine Motion\n\n**7th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou channel a watery flow through your mind, allowing you to move instantly as though it were your turn.\n\n#### Diamond Defence\n\n**8th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a colourless glass bead)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nWhen you would make a saving throw, you can use this Maneuvers  before making the roll. You automatically pass the saving throw instead of rolling it.\n\n___\n\nAlternatively, when you fail a saving throw, you can use this Maneuvers  to re-roll it, and you get advantage on the re-roll. In this case, you use it after the DM reveals whether the roll is passed or failed.\n\n#### Time Stands Still\n\n**9th-level Diamond Mind**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nTake an extra turn after this one. During the extra turn, you can't use this Maneuvers  again.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n**Q:** Can I take a reaction between my turns? Do I get an extra reaction per round when I get an extra turn?\n___\n**A:** Yes to both questions, though you don't usually have much opportunity to use the reaction.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Diamond Mind discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of diamond mind Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of diamond mind Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two diamond mind Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n\n#### Tiger's Eye Clarity (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, you focus on defending yourself against one particular enemy to the exclusion of all others. That enemy has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, but other enemies have advantage on attack rolls against you. You choose an enemy to defend yourself against when you enter the stance in combat, whenever you enter combat, and at the start of each of your turns in combat.\n\n#### Pearl of Black Doubt (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, your dodges crush the spirit of enemies with every miss. You get a bonus to AC equal to the number of attacks that have missed you since your last turn.\n\n#### Prismatic Wind (9**)\nYour perception becomes so fine-tuned that you can hear your foes' slightest movements on the wind, allowing you to locate invisible enemies with pinpoint accuracy. While you are in this stance, you have blindsight out to 30 feet, and advantage on perception checks to hear creatures.\n\n#### Declaration in Jade (15***)\nYour hand glows a bright green colour, and seems to move almost of its own accord. While you are in this stance, you can initiate one Maneuvers  that would normally use your reaction without actually using your reaction - essentially, you get an extra reaction each round that can only be used to initiate Maneuvers s.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# The Iron Heart\n___\n*\"The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions but by iron and blood.\"*\n\n*\u2014 Otto von Bismarck*\n#\nAbsolute mastery of the sword is the goal of the Iron Heart discipline. Through unending practice and study, the Iron Heart adept achieves superhuman skill with their weapons. Iron Heart Maneuvers s are demonstrations of uncanny martial skill\u2014weaving patterns of steel that dizzy, confuse, and ultimately kill with no recourse.\n\n## Associated Skill\n##### Perception\n\n## Initiating Abilities\n##### Dexterity, Consitution\n\n## Discipline Powers\n\n### Steel Skin\nFrom 3rd level, when you take this favoured discipline, you get a +1 bonus to AC so long as you are wearing armour.\n\n### Mithril Stride\nFrom 13th level, your enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls for opportunity attacks they make against you.\n\n### Adamantine Fist\nFrom 17th level, when you attack, you can make an unarmed strike in addition to your normal weapon attacks, which is usually used to allow you to benefit an extra time from an effect that improves your attack damage or make another attempt to land a Maneuvers  that requires that you hit.\n\n## Maneuvers s\nThe following Maneuvers s are part of the Iron Heart discipline. To learn one, you must know at least one other iron heart Maneuvers  per asterisk (*) after the level.\n\n##### 1st Level\nSteely Strike\n\n##### 2nd Level\nDisarming Strike, Wall of Blades\n\n##### 3rd Level*\nExorcism of Steel, Iron Heart Surge (Dispel Magic)\n\n##### 4th Level**\nLightning Recovery, Mithral Tornado\n\nSteel Wind Strike is an exception to Maneuvers s having different names from the spell, because it's just too perfect already - you couldn't tell it from the rest without knowing.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n##### 5th Level**\nDazing Strike, Iron Heart Focus, Steel Wind Strike<SUP>XGtE</SUP>\n\n##### 6th Level**\nIron Heart Endurance, Manticore Parry\n\n##### 7th Level***\nShatter the Rust, Wolfram Scything Blade\n\n##### 8th Level***\nAdamantine Hurricane, Titanium Throw\n\n##### 9th Level****\nStrike of Orichalcum Clarity\n\n#### Steely Strike\n**1st-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** 1 round\n___\n\nYou focus yourself on a single enemy of your choice. You have advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy but other enemies have advantage on attack rolls against you.\n\n#### Disarming Strike\n**2nd-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (A knucklebone)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make an attack action, and for each melee attack that hits, you can then attempt to disarm the target of that attack (see DMG 271) even if the disarm rules are not in use.\n\n#### Wall of Blades\n**2nd-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen you are hit with an attack, you can use this Maneuvers  to make an attack roll with a melee weapon you are holding (you're not holding your own unarmed strike!). If your modified attack roll is higher than the attack roll that just hit you, the attack misses instead. The exception is that if the original attack roll was a critical hit, you must also score a critical hit to deflect the attack, but if you score a critical hit, the attack is deflected no matter how high it is.\n\n- Critical attack only: Never deflects\n- Critical reaction only: Always deflects\n- Criticial attack and reaction: Always deflects.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** [Literally any question involving Iron Heart Surge.]\n___\n**A:** For the uninitiated, Iron Heart Surge used to be a Maneuvers  that was clearly meant to allow you to resist abilities, but ended up letting you dispel them instead. It's not clear exactly what it was meant to allow you to resist - try working out what \"spell, effect, or other condition currently affecting you\" means. Particularly liberal interpretations might have let you shrug off the sun. Rather than work out what the hell it's meant to do, it's now dispel magic. Rage on.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Exorcism of Steel\n**3rd-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Reach\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** 1 minute/1 round\n___\nYou furiously strike, doing no damage, but instead causing a shockwave of pain that prevents a creature from attacking accurately. The target gets disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute, but a strength save reduces this to just one round.\n\n#### Lightning Recovery\n**4th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V,\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nWhen you miss with an attack, you can initiate this Maneuvers  to re-roll the attack roll. The attack still gets any bonus damage, advantage or disavantage on the attack roll, or so forth. Essentially, you make it again as though you hadn't rolled the attack yet.\n\n#### Mithral Tornado\n**4th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a leaf)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou spin around with your blade, striking multiple foes. Make a single melee attack against each enemy within your reach. You get a +2 bonus on each of the attack rolls.\n\n#### Dazing Strike\n**5th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou bring your weapon down hard, potentially dazing your opponent. Your attack deals normal damage if it hits, and if it does, your target must take a constitution save. If they fail the save, they can't take any actions or reactions for one round, and if they've taken their reaction this round, they don't recover it on their next turn.\n\n#### Iron Heart Focus\n**5th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a pinch of iron filings)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou can use this Maneuvers  when you fail a saving throw to re-roll the saving throw. You still have any bonuses, penalties, advantage or disadvantage that you had on the initial roll.\n\n#### Iron Heart Endurance\n**6th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 bonus action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a drop of your own blood)\n\n**Duration:** 1 minute\n___\nYou gain temporary hit points equal to four times your highest Maneuvers  level.\n\n#### Manticore Parry\n**6th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 reaction\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S, M (a fragment of manticore spine)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nManticore Parry works like Wall of Blades (see previous page) except that if you deflect a melee attack, you can redirect the attack into another creature adjacent to you (ignoring whether or not the attacker could normally hit that creature from where they're standing). Use the attacker's initial attack roll to determine whether the attack hits or misses its new target (if the attack roll was initially 20, it will critically hit the new target).\n\n#### Shatter the Rust\n**7th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a few flakes of rust)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a melee attack against a creature, which does additional damage equal to the difference between that creature's maximum and current hit points, or half as much on a successful constitution save.\n\n#### Wolfram Scything Blade\n**7th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M\n\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n___\nYour blade moves with unparallelled speed. Whenever you hit for the first time in your turn with a melee weapon attack, you can make one more melee attack, but only against a different target.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n**Q:** How does Wolfram Scything Blade work with other Maneuvers s?\n___\n**A:** You can both make a scything attack and a disarming attack if you have WSB active when you use disarming strike, and the scything attack gives you another disarming attack. You can re-roll the WSB attack with lighting recovery or use lightning recovery to make an attack hit so you can claim the WSB attack. You can choose what order you attack enemies with for mithral tornado, and when the first of those attacks hit, hit another using WSB. You get a normal extra attack with dazing strike and shatter the rust, not one with a bonus effect. You don't get any benefit with wall of blades or exorcism of steel at all.\n\n##### ................................................................................\n\n#### Adamantine Hurricane\n**8th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, M (a butterfly wing)\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou spin around with your blade, striking multiple foes. Make two melee attacks against each enemy within your reach. You get a +4 bonus on each of the attack rolls.\n\n#### Titanium Throw\n**8th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** 30 foot line\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\n\nYou throw your weapon, and it bursts straight through every single creature in its path, before levitating ominously back to your hand. Each creature on a 30 foot line takes 15d6 points of damage. A successful dexterity save halves the damage.\n\n#### Strike of Orichalcum Clarity\n**9th-level Iron Heart**\n\n**Initiation Time:** 1 action\n\n**Range:** Self\n\n**Components:** V, S\n\n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n___\nYou make a single melee attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 100 points of damage to the target. If the attack is a critical hit, it deals an extra 200 points of damage to the target instead.\n\n## Stances\nThe following stances are part of the Iron Heart discipline. Each one has a minimum level and a minimum number of iron heart Maneuvers s you must know to learn it, denoted by a number telling you the minimum level and a number of asterisks equal to the number of iron heart Maneuvers s you must know - for example, 9** means you must know two iron heart Maneuvers s and have reached 9th level.\n___\n\n#### Punishing Stance (1)\nWhile you are in this stance, you deal 1d6 extra points of damage with each attack, but take a -2 penalty to your AC.\n\n#### Absolute Steel (5*)\nWhile you are in this stance, your speed increases by 10 feet. If you move at least 10 feet away from your initial position in a round, you get a +1 bonus to AC during that round.\n\n#### Dancing Blade Form (9**)\nWhile you are in this stance, your reach increases by 5 feet during your turn only. Outside of your turn, you use your ordinary reach for determining whether or not enemies provoke opportunity attacks from you and the reach of any attacks you can make as a reaction.\n\n#### Supreme Blade Parry (15***)\nWhile you are in this stance, so long as you are proficient with a melee weapon you are wielding (not just your unarmed strike) you reduce any damage you take by your proficiency bonus, after applying any damage resistance or vulnerability, to a minimum of 0.\n\n# The Jade Ph\u0153nix\n___\n*\"\"The ph\u0153nix must burn to emerge.\"*\n\n*\u2015 Janet Fitch,* White Oleander\n\n#\nManeuvers s and magic cannot stand apart for long.

You can use your dexterity instead of your strength to determine your bonus to attack and damage rolls with an unarmed strike. Also, while you are unarmed, you can treat your unarmed strike as a melee weapon you are holding whenever a Maneuvers  or stance specifies that it requires you to have a weapon.\n\n### Waning Moon Sight\nAt 13th level, you learn to percieve enemies you can't see.
